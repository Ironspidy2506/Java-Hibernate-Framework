# 💤 Hibernate in Java

Hibernate is a Java framework that simplifies database operations by mapping Java objects to database tables. It eliminates the need to write complex SQL queries, allowing you to interact with the database using Java objects.

## 🗝️ Key Features:
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Maps Java classes to database tables.
- **HQL (Hibernate Query Language)**: A query language that uses Java objects instead of tables.
- **Lazy Loading**: Loads data from the database only when needed.
- **Caching**: Improves performance by storing frequently accessed data.
- **Transaction Management**: Manages database transactions efficiently.


## 💡 Why Use Hibernate?
- Reduces the amount of database code you need to write.
- Works across different databases without changing your code.
- Simplifies CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.



## 📂 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Caching
In Hibernate, caching helps improve performance by reducing the number of database hits. It stores frequently accessed data in memory to speed up retrieval.

### 2️⃣ Cascading
Cascading refers to the propagation of certain operations from a parent entity to its associated child entities. It can be applied to operations like persist, delete, update, etc.

### 3️⃣ Criteria API
The Criteria API allows you to construct queries programmatically, making it easier to build dynamic queries in Hibernate.

### 4️⃣ HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
HQL is an object-oriented query language that allows you to query the database using the object model instead of SQL.

### 5️⃣ Mapping
Mapping is the process of linking Java objects to database tables. It defines how properties of Java objects correspond to database columns.

### 6️⃣ Pagination
Pagination is the technique of breaking large data sets into smaller, manageable parts. In Hibernate, it is commonly used to retrieve a subset of results.

### 7️⃣ SQLQuery
SQLQuery allows you to execute native SQL queries in Hibernate. It's useful when you need to execute database-specific queries directly.

### 8️⃣ States of Entities
Entities in Hibernate have three possible states: Transient, Persistent, and Detached. Understanding the state of an entity is crucial for managing its lifecycle.
